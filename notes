PLAN
want to be able to rake generate_site

when I run the task, generate a static HTML website in a directory called _site

In that site:
-index.html that links to all artists, genres, songs

-artists/index.html -Artists index

  -list of all artists with links to individual artists show pages

-artists/fun.html artists show

-should list all of the songs for an artist, each song link to song show page

-songs/index.html -Song Index

-Show the song name (song youtube vid too?)
